# Neural-Machine-Translation
## This is a natural language processing course-based project. The project is to designed an RNN-based encoder and decoder with fancy architecture to translate Chinese/Vietnamese to English.



## To do list
1. Add dataloader
2. Bleu score
3. Save model
4. Self-attention
5. cuda
6. Multiple layers in encoder and decoder
7. Without Attention
8. Beam Search
9. Play around the original data with respect to tokenization



## To be discussed
1. Used max_length = 100 from source sentence in both encoder and decoder?
