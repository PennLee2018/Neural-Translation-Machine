# Neural-Machine-Translation
## This is a natural language processing course-based project. The project is to designed an RNN-based encoder and decoder with fancy architecture to translate Chinese/Vietnamese to English.



## To do list
1. Add dataloader
2. Bleu score
3. Save model
4. Self-attention
5. Multiple layers in encoder and decoder
6. Without Attention
7. Bean Search
8. BPE
9. Revtok to detokenize
10. Play around the original data with respect to tokenization
